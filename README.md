# Infernium
A Minecraft mod intended on overhauling progression. 

## What is this?
Infernium is a Minecraft mod in very early development that intends to overhaul and extend game progression. The main objective is to keep a vanilla feel while still being an extension. This mod is *nowhere* near being complete, so don't expect too much from it yet.

## What does it add?
The mod adds weapons, tools, and armor past netherite. It also extends bows, adding more of them to make using bows a viable playstyle, including bows made of vanilla materials (stone, gold, diamond, netherite), and some custom bows.

Items before Infernium/Nihilium (the tool set past Netherite) also planned to be added, allowing for a more diverse experience before moving onto late-game sets.
